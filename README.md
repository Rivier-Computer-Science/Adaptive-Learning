# Introduction Multi-Agent Adaptive Learning

This code is from Rivier University's Professional Seminar class (COMP-699) from the Summer of 2024, the Fall of 2024, and the Spring of 2025.

It uses [Microsoft's autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Getting-Started/) to specialize an agent for each function of an adaptive learning system. The model used is OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o.

It uses [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) for the chat interface. It opens in a web browser.

There is [a paper published by the Rivier Academic Journal](https://www2.rivier.edu/journal/ROAJ-Summer-2024/J1324_Glossner%20et%20al_2024.pdf) describing the system.

## Executing the Code


```sh
~/Adaptive-Learning$ uv run python -m src.UI.panel_gui_tabs_jg
```




## Recommended Installation

Use a github codespace


## 

## Local Windows

### Install WSL and Ubuntu24.04

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

open PowerShell in admin mode (right click on program)
`wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04`

To see all the available Linux distributions

`wsl --list --online`

reboot your machine



### Install Docker Desktop

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

reboot 

start Docker desktop and configure it to start on Windows boot (Settings->General)



### Open Ubuntu in WSL

In Windows search, type Ubuntu and select Ubuntu-24.04

create your userid

create a password  <---- DON'T FORGET IT



### Follow the Install Linux Software Instructions

From here, the directions for Linux and Windows running Linux are the same except where noted.



# Install Linux Software (in Ubuntu or WSL Ubuntu)

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    software-properties-common \
    curl \
    zip \
    unzip \
    tar \
    ca-certificates \
    git \
    wget \
    build-essential \
    vim \
    jq \
    firefox \  
    wslu \
    && sudo apt clean`



### Install uv and venv

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation

`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`



### Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download



### Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/Rivier-Computer-Science/Adaptive-Learning.git`

cd into Adaptive-Learning and initialize a venv environment

`uv venv --python 3.12`

Activate the environment

`source .venv/bin/activate`



### Install Python requirements.txt

`uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setting up Fernet Key for encryption

In your terminal, run the following Python command:

`python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`

This will output a string .Add that key as `FERNET_KEY=` to your .env


### Steps to run migration script

To migrate existing users to Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database, use the provided migration script.

Ensure your script (e.g., migrate_firestore_users.py) points to your CSV file.

In your terminal, load the .env file after the changes are made and run then run below command:

`python migrate_firestore_users.py`

You should see output as All users migrated!! message.


### Set up the Default Browser for Windows Display

Note: Linux users should not need to perform this step.

If your Windows browser does not open automatically:

Option 1: All http requests use the Windows browser:
`sudo apt install wslu
echo 'export BROWSER=wsluview' >> ~/.bashrc`

Option 2: Only this project uses the Windows browser:

`sudo apt install wslu`

echo 'export BOKEH_BROWSER=wsluview' >> ~/.bashrc`

Option 3: Run the browser from within Ubuntu: :
`echo 'export BOKEH_BROWSER=firefox' >> ~/.bashrc`



## Set Environment Variables

Sign up to get an [OpenAI Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-     # available form platform.openai.com
```

Note: for Windows use *set* instead of *export*


### SU25

- **Enhanced Autogen JSON Output**
  - Added structured fields: `topic`, `timestamp`, `steps_completed`, `suggestions`.
  - Improved clarity and consistency of session JSON data.

- **Firebase Firestore Integration**
  - Session data now writes to Firestore for persistent storage.
  - Includes a user migration script using CSV import format.

- **Session Replay Enhancement**
  - Restored sessions from Firebase now resume seamlessly with correct state.
  - Fixed FSM transition and agent routing bugs during replay.
  - Ensures the learning flow continues from the previous point without duplication or loss.
  - Preserves pending_problem and maintains proper chat sequence.


# Agents

There are 11 agents used in the adaptive learning system:

| **Agents**         | **Role**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student            | A user proxy for a student who wants to learn mathematics.               |
| Knowledge Tracer   | Determine the Student's mathematical capabilities.                       |
| Teacher            | Present new material in multiple formats.                                |
| Tutor              | Explain answers to a Student. Help a Student to learn new material or review previous materials. |
| Problem Generator  | Generate math problems at the appropriate level for the Student.         |
| Solution Verifier  | Check the Student's solutions to math problems.                          |
| Programmer         | Write python code to solve math problem.                                 |
| Code Runner        | Execute python code and display the result.                              |
| Level Adapter      | Determine when to increase or decrease the level of difficulty for a Student. |
| Learner Model      | A model of the Student's learning level.                                 |
| Motivator          | Provides positive and encouraging feedback to the Student.               |

# Agent Communications

We had hoped to use an unconstrained `autogen.GroupChatManager` to manage agent communications. Try as we may, we could not get agents to stay within their assigned roles. We eventually resorted to a state machine for agent selection using the panel gui. The limitation of this approach means there is a very specific learning path. See the paper for details.

The console knowledge tracer program uses direct agent communication.

## State Machine in panel UI

# Panel UI

The UI contains multiple tabs in various states of completion. The Learn tab is the main interface. 

![panel_ui](~/../pics/panel_ui.png)

The Model tab interacts with the LearnerModel agent and provides an assessment of the student's capabilities.
