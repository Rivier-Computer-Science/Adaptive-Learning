      "content": "Subtraction is one of the basic operations in arithmetic, and it's essential for understanding more complex mathematical concepts. Let's dive into the topic of subtraction, starting with the basics and moving on to some examples.\n\n### What is Subtraction?\n\nSubtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. It is the opposite of addition. The result of a subtraction operation is called the \"difference.\"\n\nIn a subtraction equation, the number from which you are subtracting is called the \"minuend,\" the number you are subtracting is the \"subtrahend,\" and the result is the \"difference.\"\n\nFor example, in the equation:\n\n\\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \\]\n\n- 8 is the minuend\n- 3 is the subtrahend\n- 5 is the difference\n\n### Basic Properties of Subtraction\n\n1. **Non-Commutative**: Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative. This means that changing the order of the numbers changes the result. For example, \\( 8 - 3 \\neq 3 - 8 \\).\n\n2. **Non-Associative**: Subtraction is also not associative, meaning that the grouping of numbers matters. For example, \\( (8 - 3) - 2 \\neq 8 - (3 - 2) \\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: Subtracting zero from any number does not change the number. For example, \\( 8 - 0 = 8 \\).\n\n### How to Perform Subtraction\n\nLet's go through a step-by-step method to perform subtraction:\n\n#### Simple Subtraction\n\n1. **Align the Numbers**: Write the numbers so that the digits are aligned by place value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).\n\n2. **Subtract Each Column**: Start from the rightmost column (units) and subtract the digits. If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, you may need to borrow from the next column to the left.\n\n3. **Borrowing**: If you need to borrow, reduce the digit in the next column to the left by one and add ten to the current column.\n\n4. **Write the Difference**: Write down the result of each column subtraction.\n\n#### Example\n\nLet's subtract 47 from 123:\n\n```\n  123\n-  47\n------\n```\n\n- Start from the rightmost column: 3 - 7. Since 3 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the tens column.\n- Borrow 1 from the tens column (2 becomes 1), making the units column 13.\n- Now, 13 - 7 = 6.\n- Move to the tens column: 1 - 4. Since 1 is less than 4, we need to borrow from the hundreds column.\n- Borrow 1 from the hundreds column (1 becomes 0), making the tens column 11.\n- Now, 11 - 4 = 7.\n- The hundreds column is now 0, so we don't need to subtract anything.\n\nThe result is:\n\n```\n  123\n-  47\n------\n   76\n```\n\n### Practice Problems\n\n1. Subtract 56 from 89.\n2. Subtract 234 from 567.\n3. Subtract 100 from 1000.\n\nTry solving these problems using the steps outlined above. Subtraction is a fundamental skill that will be useful in many areas of mathematics and everyday life. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
