#  Code Review Checklist – Sprint 3 (Fallback Handling & UI Refinement)

This checklist guides the reviewer through the key areas modified in Sprint 3.

##  General

- [ ] Code compiles and runs without errors.
- [ ] Docstrings and inline comments are added for all major methods.
- [ ] No commented-out debug code remains (e.g., print statements).
- [ ] All strings and messages follow consistent formatting.

##  LangGraph Integration

- [ ] `graph.invoke()` has error-handling for missing/invalid outputs.
- [ ] Handles `code_output`, `tracer_output`, and `student_output` safely.
- [ ] Fallbacks display clear UI messages when values are missing.

##  Fallback/Error Handling

- [ ] `fallback_panel` is used when appropriate.
- [ ] Missing `tracer_output` shows meaningful feedback.
- [ ] Errors (e.g., no response from graph) show `error_panel` content.
- [ ] "No code output" or "Unknown Error" messages are clear and helpful.

##  UI Improvements

- [ ] Colored feedback ( Success,  Error,  Warning) is consistent.
- [ ] Output panels reset before execution to avoid stale content.
- [ ] Panels are ordered logically: fallback → student → stdout → tracer → error.

##  Documentation

- [ ] `README.md` is updated with Sprint 3 summary.
- [ ] `edge-cases.md` describes known edge case behaviors and system responses.
