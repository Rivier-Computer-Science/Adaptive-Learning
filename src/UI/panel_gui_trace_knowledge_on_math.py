## panel_gui_trace_knowledge_on_math.py

#
# Use Case Name: Trace Knowledge on Math
# ID: 5.6
# Importance Level: High

# Primary Actor: Student
# Use Case Type: User Goal

# Stakeholders and Interests:
# - Student: Wants to track their understanding and mastery of Math concepts.
# - Teacher: Wants to monitor student progress and provide targeted assistance.
# - Administrator: Interested in overall student performance metrics.

# Brief Description:
# The student uses the system to trace their knowledge on various Math topics. The system helps them identify areas of strength and weakness, providing feedback and resources for improvement.

# Trigger:
# The student logs into the system and selects the option to trace their knowledge on Math.

# Type: 
# User-Initiated

# Relationships:
# Association: Student, Teacher, Administrator
# Include: Assessment, Feedback, Progress Tracking
# Extend: Personalized Recommendations

# Normal Flow of Events:
# 1. Student logs into the system.
# 2. Student selects "Trace Knowledge on Math".
# 3. The system presents an assessment covering various Math topics.
# 4. Student completes the assessment.
# 5. The system analyzes the results and provides feedback.
# 6. The system highlights areas of strength and weakness.
# 7. The system offers resources for improvement in weak areas.
# 8. Student reviews the feedback and resources.

# SubFlows:
# S-1: If the student scores above a certain threshold, they receive a badge of mastery.
# S-2: If the student scores below a certain threshold, they are prompted to take additional assessments.

# Alternate/Exceptional Flows:
# A-1: If the system encounters an error during the assessment, it notifies the student and logs the error.
# A-2: If the student disagrees with the feedback, they can request a review from a teacher.

# I've set all the Agents to the prompts found to be "best" in Sprint-2
# 
# Below are examplex of how to override defaults in this file instead of agent file
#
# I believe these are the only 3 you will need to change
#
# If you find otherwise, you will need to directly update the agents
#    becasue I only created constructors for these additional parameters
