User Firestore Migration Script

Purpose:
--------
This script migrates existing Firebase Authentication users in the Firestore `users` collection
to ensure their `name`, `email`, and `gender` fields are properly encrypted using the current
Fernet key as configured in the `.env` file. 

Background:
-----------
Earlier versions of the application may have:
- Created users in Firebase Auth but not written encrypted user profile fields to Firestore.
- Used a different Fernet encryption key, resulting in fields that are missing or cannot be decrypted by the app.

Why this matters:
-----------------
- The Adaptive Learning app expects every user document in Firestore to contain `name`, `email`, and `gender` fields,
  encrypted using the current Fernet key.
- Without these fields (or if encrypted with a wrong key), user features like displaying the userâ€™s name or writing
  session JSON will fail or show `"N/A"`.

How this script helps:
----------------------
- Reads a CSV(users_to_migrate.csv) list of user UIDs, names, emails, and genders.
            Example for users_to_migrate.csv:
            uid,name,email,gender
            <paste_uid_here>,John Doe,john@example.com,Male
            
- Encrypts each field with the current Fernet key.
- Updates or creates the appropriate Firestore document for each user.
- Ensures all users (including old ones) can log in and have their profile fields correctly displayed and used by the app.

Usage:
------
1. Update the `.env` file with the correct `FERNET_KEY` and `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`.
2. Prepare a CSV file (`users_to_migrate.csv`) with columns: `uid,name,email,gender`.
3. Run this script.
4. Old users will now have their Firestore docs compatible with the current app.
